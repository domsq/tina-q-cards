Tina Q Cards is a website selling bespoke handmade greeting cards for occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, get well soon and so on.

### Design

#### Imagery

- My application features a simple background image showing some texture on the homepage. The other images present are those for the products. I also make use of Font Awesome icons for some additional visual flourish.

#### Typography

- The fonts used in my application are "Corben" for any heading type text and "Montserrat" for any remaining content. These come from Google Fonts. 

#### Colour scheme

- The colour scheme is based around darker pink and red colours (#AB274F, #CA9FB5, #A16484) with a very dark purple colour used for certain backgrounds and also for some button elements (#54424B). The palette for this was determined using [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23AB274F&sub=1) and is known as the "Neighbor Palette":

- ![Image of colour palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/colour_palette.JPG)<br>

- The colour #AB274F has also been used for certain button elements and for various headings. It is the primary colour for the site with the other colours used to support it. 

### Schema

The schema overview for my application is as below:

![Image of schema overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/schema.JPG)<br>

As seen above, the Category table has a one-to-many link with Product as one category can contain many products.
The Order table has a one-to-many link with OrderLineItem, as one order can contain many line items. There is also a one-to-many link between Product and OrderLineItem as the same product can appear in many line items on different orders.<br><br>
There is a one-to-many relationship between UserProfile and Order as one user can have many orders associated with them. The UserProfile table also has a one-to-one link with the built-in Django User model (shown here for demonstration purposes) as each user can have only one profile linked to them. The BlogPost table has a one-to-many relationship with Reply, which allows for multiple replies to a particular blog post. There is also a one-to-many relationship between the User model and the Reply table as one user may have many replies.<br><br>

The ContactUs table is standalone with no links to any other tables.<br><br>

The details for each model are as follows:

For the final version of my site, the newsletter signup is on the left instead of the right now in the footer.

### Business Model

The business model used for my application is B2C. The reason I chose this is because the products I will be selling are aimed at consumers and not businesses. The product selection and checkout flow allow for quick and straightforward purchases, which is not something you would use in a B2B environment. 

### Marketing Strategy

In terms of the marketing strategy choices employed for my application, I have made use of the following:<br>

- Social media advertising, due to it being a no cost option and potentially able to reach many users
- Email advertising due to the relative simplicity of creating newsletters or offers for potential and existing customers
- SEO and looking to rank well in searches on Google to aid visibility of my application

### Facebook Business Page

The Facebook Business Page created for my project is as follows and makes use of the same imagery and logo. It is also linked to in the footer of my application.

Home page:<br>
![Wireframe of FB home page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/fb_page1.JPG)<br>

Info:<br>

## Features

The application has been tested using the Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers at full width on a 1080p and 4K monitor, as well as a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G handset. The following emulated device sizes were checked:<br>
<br>

- Chrome \ Edge
    - Galaxy S5
    - Pixel 2 XL
    - iPhone 6/7/8
    - iPhone X
    - iPad
    - iPad Pro
- Firefox
    - Galaxy S10/S10+
    - Galaxy S20 Ultra
    - iPad
    - iPhone 11 Pro
    - iPhone 12/13 +
    - iPhone SE 2nd gen

The application behaved as expected at the different viewport widths. While it functions as expected on a 4K monitor, it is optimised for screens 1080p and lower. 

### Bugs

During the development of my application, I encountered the following bugs which I managed to resolve in each case:

- While trying to adjust the nav links colour, I had forgotten to specifically target the "a" elements.
- The header logo wouldn't initially display when using src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}tqc-logo.png", this was due to the context processor "'django.template.context_processors.media'," not being present. Adding this corrected the issue.
- The logo on the mobile nav header wouldn't display initially, this was due to me adjusting the path on the main header but not the mobile one. Once set to src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}tqc-logo.png", this worked as expected. 
- When configuring the basket page to show product images, this would crash if a product had no image associated. This was corrected using an if statement to check for a product image and if none, display a "noimage" image instead. 
- When configuring the remove from basket functionality, I was getting a "CSRF token missing or invalid" error. This was due to my having put the associated JS into a separate file, turns out to be able to read the CSRF token, the script code needed to be directly in the template instead. 
- I had an issue where when browsing to the homepage, the Django messaging system was picking up and displaying the homepage welcome title and displaying it. This was due to my referencing “messages” to display the contents of the WelcomeMessage model. The fix was to rather display the text directly in the index.html template and remove the context from the “home” view.
- When configuring the checkout template, for the basket preview section, I mistakenly used the url “product_detail” which doesn’t exist and so got an error. Changing this to “product_details”, which does exist, fixed the issue.
- When defining the “update_total” method in the Order model, where I referenced the key [‘lineitem_total_sum’], this caused a key error. This needed to be set to [‘lineitem_total__sum’].
- While testing the Stripe webhook functionality in Gitpod, I initially was getting 401 errors and it didn’t seem to be reaching my test server. I needed to set port 8000 to public. 
- When trying to update my Order table to use the django-country field, the migration for this failed as I had existing orders that weren’t using a valid 2 digit code. Removing these orders (which were only test ones) allowed the migrate operation to complete successfully.
- My checkout wasn’t initially working once I’d deployed, this was because I’d forgotten to set the “STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY”, “STRIPE_SECRET_KEY” and “STRIPE_WH_SECRET” environment variables on Heroku. 
- When configuring the profiles app, I had to temporarily adjust the signal for profile creation to create a profile for my user. Upon testing, and before setting the signal back to what it should be, I was getting errors about the user profile already existing (this was due to the signal trying to create a new profile regardless). Once the signal was reset to what it should be, the error was resolved.
- If you scroll all the way down on the products page, getting right to the bottom of the footer, the BTT button wouldn't work. Adding z-index of 1 fixed this.
- When configuring Summernote for the body field on the BlogPost model admin view, I forgot to add the URLs to the base URL file, resulting in a “Not found” error. Correctly adding the URLs to the base URL file fixed this.
- When configuring the blog overview template, the posts weren’t displaying as I intended, namely side by side on larger screens. This was due to me having put the containing div for the posts outside the for loop for generating the posts, rather than inside it. 
- When creating the blog detail page, which shows all related replies, I was initially getting an error regarding "‘RelatedManager’ object is not iterable" when trying to render the replies. This was due to my having referenced the associated replies in the view as "replies = post.blog_replies" instead of "replies = post.blog_replies.all()"

    ![Image of product detail page validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/validation/html/product_detail_validate.JPG)<br>
    The error noted is due to my having to use the "linebreaks" filter on the item description to allow it to display correctly.
    - Basket page:<br>
    ![Image of basket page validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/validation/html/basket_validate.JPG)<br>
    The error noted here is due to the fact that the basket page has a mobile view and one for larger screens, for this to work the required code 
    (which is in an include file) appears twice in the DOM.
    - Checkout page:<br>
    ![Image of checkout page validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/validation/html/checkout_validate.JPG)<br>
    The warning noted here is due to the structure of the overlay spinner, which appears while checkout is processing.

    - Blog reply edit page:<br>
    ![Image of blog reply edit page validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domsq/tina-q-cards/master/screenshots/validation/html/edit_reply_validate.JPG)<br>
    The error noted relates to my using Summernote to edit the body text in the admin view. As this page also shows the blog post detail, this is why the same error appears.

## Credits 

### Content

All content, apart from the background image for the homepage, was created by the developer (with help from my wife, who assisted me with the colour scheme, logo and product images as we thought it would be nice to be able to showcase some of her handmade cards). Also, the Facebook business page was created by her some time back (although inactive) but repurposed for this project with her permission. The Instagram page linked to in the footer was already active and in use.

As always, many thanks to my mentor Akshat Garg for his invaluable advice and guidance. Earlier on in the design of my application, I had a model called "WelcomeMessage" for the homepage introduction text and also what is now "Tina's Blog" was originally going to be called "About Us". I removed "WelcomeMessage" and adjusted "About Us" to "Tina's Blog" following some discussion with Akshat.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to acknowledge the Code Institute Slack community, who helped me whenever I had a query about my project or something related. Thanks guys!
